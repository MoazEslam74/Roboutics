    "## What is Path Planning?\n",
    "Path planning, also known as motion planning, is a computational process that determines a viable path for an autonomous agent (e.g., a robot) to move from a starting point to a destination without colliding with obstacles. It is a fundamental aspect of robotics, enabling robots to operate autonomously in diverse and dynamic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications in Robotics\n",
    "Path planning is crucial in various robotic applications, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Autonomous Vehicles: Navigating roads, avoiding obstacles, and reaching destinations efficiently.\n",
    "- Industrial Automation: Moving robotic arms and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) within factories.\n",
    "- Service Robots: Assisting in tasks within homes, hospitals, and public spaces.\n",
    "- Exploration Robots: Navigating unknown terrains in space missions or underwater exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges in Path Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Path planning involves addressing several challenges to ensure efficient and safe navigation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic Environments: Environments that change over time require adaptive planning.\n",
    "- High-Dimensional Spaces: Robots with many degrees of freedom operate in complex spaces.\n",
    "- Real-Time Constraints: Time-sensitive applications demand swift computation.\n",
    "- Optimization Goals: Balancing multiple objectives like shortest path, energy efficiency, and safety.\n",

    "## **A\\* (A-Star) Algorithm**\n",
    "### Algorithm Overview\n",
    "A* (A-Star) Algorithm is an informed search algorithm that enhances Dijkstra's by incorporating heuristics to prioritize nodes that are likely closer to the goal. This makes A* more efficient by reducing the search space. <br>\n",
    "![A*](figures/A-star.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the context of path planning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traversal Order: Prioritizes nodes based on the sum of the cost to reach them and an estimated cost to the goal.\n",
    "- Guarantees: Finds the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the true cost).\n",
    "### Heuristic Functions\n",
    "- A heuristic function estimates the cost from a node to the goal. The choice of heuristic significantly impacts A*'s performance.\n",
    "#### Common Heuristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Manhattan Distance:\n",
    "- measures the distance between two points by only allowing movement along axes at right angles. Imagine navigating a grid-like city (like Manhattan), where you can only move horizontally or vertically. <br>\n",
    "![manhattan](figures/manhattan.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Euclidean Distance:\n",
    "- most commonly used distance metric, representing the \"straight-line\" distance between two points in Euclidean space. It's akin to measuring the shortest path between two points using a ruler. <br>\n",
    "![euclidean](figures/euclidean.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Chebyshev Distance:\n",
    "- measures the greatest of the differences along any coordinate dimension. It represents the minimum number of moves a king would take to move from one square to another on a chessboard, allowing movement in any direction (including diagonally). <br>\n",
    "![chebychev](figures/chebyshev.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Admissibility: A heuristic is admissible if it never overestimates the true cost to reach the goal. This ensures that A* finds the optimal path.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![all](figures/all.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Analysis\n",
    "    - Time Complexity: O(E) in the worst case, but typically much better due to heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Space Complexity: O(V)\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "    - Efficiency: Heuristics guide the search, reducing the number of explored nodes.\n",
    "    - Optimality: Guarantees the shortest path with admissible heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages:\n",
    "    - Heuristic Dependency: Performance heavily relies on the chosen heuristic.\n",
    "    - Memory Usage: Can still consume significant memory for large grids."
