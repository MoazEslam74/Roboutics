    "# **Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)**\n",
    "## Conceptual Overview\n",
    "Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) is a sampling-based path planning algorithm designed to efficiently search high-dimensional spaces. RRT incrementally builds a tree that spans the search space by randomly sampling points and extending the tree towards these samples. It is particularly effective in environments with complex obstacles and is suitable for real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics of RRT\n",
    "- Exploration Efficiency: Quickly explores large, high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "- Incremental Growth: Builds the tree incrementally, allowing for real-time path planning.\n",
    "- Probabilistic Completeness: Guarantees that a path will be found if one exists, given sufficient time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Details\n",
    "RRT operates through the following steps:\n",
    "1. Initialization:\n",
    "    - Start with a tree containing only the start node.\n",
    "2. Sampling:\n",
    "    - Randomly sample a point in the configuration space.\n",
    "3. Nearest Neighbor:\n",
    "    - Find the nearest node in the tree to the sampled point.\n",
    "4. Steering:\n",
    "    - Move from the nearest node towards the sampled point by a fixed step size.\n",
    "5. Collision Checking:\n",
    "    - Ensure that the path between the nearest node and the new node is free from obstacles.\n",
    "6. Tree Expansion:\n",
    "    - If the path is collision-free, add the new node to the tree.\n",
    "7. Goal Checking:\n",
    "    - If the new node is sufficiently close to the goal, connect it directly to the goal.\n",
    "8. Iteration:\n",
    "    - Repeat steps 2-7 until the goal is reached or a maximum number of iterations is exceeded."

    "## Detailed Analysis\n",
    "1. Path Found:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If a path is found, it demonstrates the RRT's ability to explore the space and connect start to goal while avoiding obstacles.\n",
    "    - The path may not be the shortest due to the nature of RRT's random exploration.\n",
    "2. No Path Found:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If no path is found within the maximum iterations, consider increasing max_iter or adjusting expand_dis.\n",
    "    - Another strategy is to bias the sampling towards the goal to increase the likelihood of reaching it.\n",
    "3. Parameters Impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - expand_dis:\n",
    "        - Larger step sizes lead to faster exploration but may skip narrow passages.\n",
    "        - Smaller step sizes allow for finer exploration but increase computation time.\n",
    "    - max_iter:\n",
    "        - Higher iterations provide more chances to find a path but increase computation time.\n",
    "    - path_resolution:\n",
    "        - Finer resolution ensures accurate collision checking but requires more computations.\n",
    "4. Algorithm Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Efficient in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "    - Capable of handling complex obstacle configurations.\n",
    "    - Probabilistically complete, meaning it will find a path if one exists given enough time.\n",

    "### What is RRT\\*?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rapidly-exploring Random Trees Star (RRT\\*)** is an extension of the standard Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm. While RRT is excellent for quickly finding feasible paths in high-dimensional spaces, it does not guarantee path optimality. RRT\\*, introduced by Karaman and Frazzoli in 2011, addresses this limitation by ensuring that the paths generated are asymptotically optimal. This means that as the number of samples approaches infinity, the path cost converges to the optimal cost.\n",

    "## Algorithm Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of RRT\\*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost-Based Node Selection**: Each node in the tree maintains the cost from the start node. When adding a new node, RRT\\* considers the cheapest path to connect it.\n",
    "2. **Rewiring**: After adding a new node, the algorithm checks neighboring nodes to see if their paths can be optimized through the new node.\n",
    "3. **Asymptotic Optimality**: Guarantees that the path cost approaches the optimal cost as the number of samples increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RRT\\* Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "    - Start with a tree containing only the start node.\n",
    "2. **Sampling**:\n",
    "    - Randomly sample a point in the configuration space.\n",
    "3. **Nearest Neighbor**:\n",
    "    - Find the nearest node in the tree to the sampled point.\n",
    "4. **Steering**:\n",
    "    - Move from the nearest node towards the sampled point by a fixed step size.\n",
    "5. **Collision Checking**:\n",
    "    - Ensure that the path between the nearest node and the new node is free from obstacles.\n",
    "6. **Near Nodes Identification**:\n",
    "    - Identify all nodes within a certain radius of the new node.\n",
    "7. **Choose Parent with Minimum Cost**:\n",
    "    - Select the node among the near nodes that offers the lowest cost path to the new node.\n",
    "8. **Add New Node**:\n",
    "    - Add the new node to the tree with the selected parent.\n",
    "9. **Rewiring**:\n",
    "    - For each near node, check if the path through the new node offers a lower cost. If so, update the parent of the near node to the new node.\n",
    "10. **Goal Checking**:\n",
    "    - If the new node is sufficiently close to the goal, and the path is collision-free, connect it to the goal.\n",
    "11. **Iteration**:\n",
    "    - Repeat steps 2-10 until the goal is reached or a maximum number of iterations is exceeded.\n",

    "# Spanning Trees\n",
    "## Conceptual Overview\n",
    "A spanning tree is a subset of a graph that connects all the vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible number of edges. In the context of path planning, spanning trees help in exploring all possible paths within a graph representation of the environment, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the navigable space.\n",
    "## Key Characteristics of Spanning Trees\n",
    "- Connectivity: Ensures all nodes (positions) are connected.\n",
    "- Acyclic: Contains no cycles, preventing redundant paths.\n",
    "- Minimality: For n nodes, a spanning tree has exactly n-1 edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Depth-First Spanning Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "A **Depth-First Spanning Tree** is a spanning tree constructed using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. Starting from a root node, DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Properties**\n",
    "- **Deep Exploration**: Nodes are added to the tree by exploring each branch to its deepest point before backtracking.\n",
    "- **Path Characteristics**: Paths from the root to any node can be long and winding, depending on the graph's structure.\n",
    "- **Cycle Detection**: DFS is effective in detecting cycles within graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Applications**\n",
    "- **Maze Solving**: DFS is used to explore all possible paths in maze-solving algorithms.\n",
    "- **Topological Sorting**: In directed acyclic graphs, DFS helps in ordering tasks.\n",
    "- **Cycle Detection**: Identifying cycles in graphs for various computational problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of DFS-based Spanning Tree Construction\n",
    "1. Initialization:\n",
    "    - Start with a root node (e.g., start position).\n",
    "    - Initialize an empty tree structure to store parent-child relationships.\n",
    "2. Traversal:\n",
    "    - Visit an adjacent unvisited node and mark it as part of the tree.\n",
    "    - Recursively apply DFS to the new node.\n",
    "3. Backtracking:\n",
    "    - If a node has no unvisited neighbors, backtrack to the previous node.\n",
    "4. Termination:\n",
    "    - The process continues until all reachable nodes are visited and included in the spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement a simple environment and generate a spanning tree using DFS"

    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "A **Minimum Spanning Tree** of a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is minimized. In other words, it connects all the vertices together with the least possible total edge weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Properties**\n",
    "- **Uniqueness**: If all edge weights are distinct, the MST is unique. Otherwise, there may be multiple MSTs with the same total weight.\n",
    "- **No Cycles**: Being a spanning tree, it contains no cycles.\n",
    "- **Connectivity**: It connects all the vertices in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Algorithms to Find MST**\n",
    "- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Builds the MST by adding the next smallest edge that doesn't form a cycle:\n",
    "    - Sort All Edges: Arrange all edges in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n",
    "    - Initialize: Start with an empty tree (no edges).\n",
    "    - Add Edges: Iterate through the sorted edges and add the smallest edge to the tree if it doesn't form a cycle.\n",
    "    - Repeat: Continue until all vertices are connected.\n",
    "- **Prim's Algorithm**: Starts from an arbitrary node and grows the MST by adding the smallest edge connecting the tree to a new vertex.\n",
    "    - Initialize: Start with a single node (the \"start\" node) and mark it as part of the MST.\n",
    "    - Select Minimum Edge: From the edges connected to the nodes in the MST, select the edge with the smallest weight that connects to a node not yet in the MST.\n",
    "    - Add to MST: Add the selected edge and the connected node to the MST.\n",
    "    - Repeat: Continue selecting the smallest edge that connects the MST to a new node until all nodes are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Applications**\n",
    "- **Network Design**: Designing least-cost networks such as computer, telecommunication, and transportation networks.\n",
    "- **Approximation Algorithms**: Serving as a foundation for algorithms solving more complex problems.\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Used in hierarchical clustering methods."

    "## Other Types of Spanning Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Spanning trees are fundamental structures in graph theory with various applications in computer science, network design, and robotics. Below are detailed explanations of different types of spanning trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Maximum Spanning Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "A **Maximum Spanning Tree** of a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is maximized. It connects all the vertices together with the highest possible total edge weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Properties**\n",
    "- **Uniqueness**: Similar to MST, if all edge weights are distinct, the Maximum Spanning Tree is unique.\n",
    "- **No Cycles**: It contains no cycles.\n",
    "- **Connectivity**: It connects all the vertices in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Algorithms to Find Maximum Spanning Tree**\n",
    "- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Modified to select edges in decreasing order of weight instead of increasing.\n",
    "- **Prim's Algorithm**: Modified to choose the maximum weight edge connecting the tree to a new vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Applications**\n",
    "- **Maximum Bandwidth Path**: Finding paths with the highest possible bandwidth in networks.\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Forming clusters based on the strongest connections.\n",
    "- **Competitive Networking**: Designing networks that can handle maximum traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Rooted Spanning Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "A **Rooted Spanning Tree** is a spanning tree in which one vertex is designated as the root. All edges are directed away from (or towards) the root, establishing a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Properties**\n",
    "- **Hierarchy**: Establishes a parent-child relationship among nodes.\n",
    "- **Traversal**: Facilitates tree traversal methods like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the root.\n",
    "- **Single Entry Point**: All paths originate from the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Applications**\n",
    "- **Organizational Structures**: Representing hierarchies in organizations.\n",
    "- **Routing Protocols**: In computer networks, protocols like Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) use rooted spanning trees to prevent loops.\n",
    "- **Data Structures**: Implementing trees in computer science, such as file directory structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Breadth-First Spanning Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "A **Breadth-First Spanning Tree** is a spanning tree constructed using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Starting from a root node, BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Properties**\n",
    "- **Level-wise Exploration**: Nodes are added to the tree in order of their distance from the root.\n",
    "- **Shortest Path**: For unweighted graphs, the BFS spanning tree contains the shortest paths from the root to all other nodes.\n",
    "- **Layered Structure**: The tree exhibits a layered structure based on node depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Applications**\n",
    "- **Shortest Path Finding**: Useful in unweighted graphs to determine the shortest path from a source to all other nodes.\n",
    "- **Broadcasting**: In networking, used to broadcast messages efficiently.\n",
    "- **Social Networking**: Analyzing connections and degrees of separation.\n",

    "# Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM)\n",
    "## Conceptual Overview\n",
    "Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) are a powerful sampling-based path planning method, particularly suited for multi-query scenarios where multiple paths between different start and goal pairs are required. PRM operates in two distinct phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Construction Phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Sampling: Randomly sample points (nodes) in the free space.\n",
    "    - Connection: Connect each sampled point to its nearest neighbors, forming a roadmap or graph.\n",
    "2. Query Phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Path Finding: Use graph search algorithms (e.g., A*) on the constructed roadmap to find a path from the start to the goal.\n",
    "## Advantages of PRM\n",
    "Multi-query Efficiency: Once the roadmap is built, multiple path queries can be efficiently answered.\n",
    "Scalability: Handles high-dimensional spaces effectively.\n",
    "Flexibility: Can adapt to various environments and obstacle configurations.\n",
    "## Algorithm Details\n",
    "- Construction Phase\n",
    "    1. Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Generate a set of random, collision-free points in the configuration space.\n",
    "        - Include the start and goal points in the set of samples.\n",
    "    2. Connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - For each sampled point, identify its k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "        - Attempt to connect the point to each neighbor via a straight-line path.\n",
    "        - Perform collision checking for each potential connection.\n",
    "        - If the path is collision-free, add an edge between the points in the roadmap.\n",
    "- Query Phase\n",
    "    1. Path Finding:\n",
    "        - Given a start and goal point, locate their nearest neighbors in the roadmap.\n",
    "        - Add the start and goal to the roadmap if they are not already present.\n",
    "        - Use a graph search algorithm (e.g., A*) to find the shortest path from start to goal within the roadmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement the PRM algorithm with Pygame for dynamic visualization. The implementation includes sampling, connecting nodes, collision checking, and path finding using A*."

    "## Key Differences Between PRM and RRT\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Algorithmic Approach:**\n",
    "   - **PRM:** Uses a two-phase approach (construction and query) to create a reusable roadmap.\n",
    "   - **RRT:** Grows a tree incrementally from the start to goal, suitable for single-query scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Structure:**\n",
    "   - **PRM:** Graph-based, with nodes as sampled configurations and edges representing feasible paths.\n",
    "   - **RRT:** Tree-based, where each node expands the search space incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sampling Strategy:**\n",
    "   - **PRM:** Employs uniform random sampling across the entire space.\n",
    "   - **RRT:** Uses biased sampling to grow the tree towards unexplored areas or the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Cases and Applications:**\n",
    "   - **PRM:** Ideal for static environments with multiple path queries.\n",
    "   - **RRT:** Best for dynamic or real-time scenarios requiring fast single-query solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance and Scalability:**\n",
    "   - **PRM:** Scales well in high-dimensional spaces and supports multiple queries efficiently.\n",
    "   - **RRT:** Faster in finding single paths but may require extensions for optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Path Optimality:**\n",
    "   - **PRM:** Provides feasible paths; optimality can be improved.\n",
    "   - **RRT:** Finds feasible paths; RRT* offers improved path optimality.\n",
